Understanding autoencoders - Can they mimic speakers?
Autoencoders are a pair of neural networks, commonly referred to as the encoder and decoder, which work as follows. The encoder takes a data sample,
  such as a speech sample, and encodes it to its latent space representation. The decoder takes the latent space representation and it reconstructs an
  estimate of the data sample.    A recent work has shown evidence for the conjecture that autoencoders can mimic speakers. In more detail, an autoencoder is initially trained using
  voice samples from a single speaker. Next, the autoencoder is fed test samples from other speakers, and it was shown experimentally that the decoder is able to reconstruct the exact speech, but in the voice of the speaker from the training samples. We hypothesize that the encoder neural network is somehow capturing the semantic characteristics, i.e., the contents of the
  speech, in the latent space representation, while the decoder neural network is able to add the   speaker characteristics to the latent space representation during the reconstruction.
 In this project, the student is expected to test out this hypothesis by designing the necessary experiments. If convincing evidence is found to support this hypothesis, the next goal will be to develop some theoretical understanding of the functioning of autoencoders using the insights gained from the experiments.  Necessary qualification: The student should be well versed in training neural networks using python. In addition, basic mathematical maturity, including some familiarity with probability and linear algebra, is also required.

Unsupervised federated learning and anomaly detection
Federated learning (FL) is proving to be one of the most promising paradigms for leveraging distributed resources for collaborative training of a machine learning model, while protecting  the privacy of individuals' data. To leverage the enormous unlabeled data on distributed edge devices, we aim to use the FL paradigm in unsupervised tasks, and in particular, we address the problem of anomaly detection in decentralized settings.

Bandwidth extension  (BWE) in automatic speech recognition
The aim is to extract  features from speech that are informative  irrespective of the sampling rate. One could think of using a generative  network to upsample the audio. Complex rich DNN models can also be explored.  Here, we are recovering missing frequency content- Bandwidth Extension in  Audio. Alternatively, one can explore employing some sort of attention  mechanism to directly extract informative features Or a mix of both approaches.    ----------------------------------
    Setup: 
    Ideally we want to implement this in a ASR pipeline using NVIDIA Reva  platform. Some of the attention based ideas might come from Computer Vision  domain. And of course there will be concepts from DSP and Speech processing.

Artificial Intelligence Driven Computational Gastronomy Framework
Cooking forms the core of our cultural identity other than being the basis of nutrition and health. The increasing availability of culinary data and the advent of computational methods for their scrutiny are dramatically changing the artistic outlook towards gastronomy. Starting with a seemingly simple question, ‘Why do we eat what we eat?’, data-driven research conducted in our lab has led to interesting explorations of traditional recipes, their flavor composition, and health associations. Our investigations have revealed ‘culinary fingerprints’ of regional cuisines across the world. Application of data-driven strategies for investigating the gastronomic data has opened up exciting avenues, giving rise to an all-new field of ‘computational gastronomy’. This emerging interdisciplinary science asks questions of culinary origin to seek their answers via the compilation of culinary data and their analysis using methods of complex systems, statistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Along with complementary experimental studies, these endeavors have the potential to transform the food landscape by effectively leveraging data-driven food innovations for better health and nutrition. Complex Systems Laboratory: https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in Computational Gastronomy is a data science which blends food with data and the power of artificial intelligence. We have an ambitious goal of creating a "Computational Gastronomy Framework" around the following themes and expertise. THEMATIC AREAS/EXPERTISE: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, API Development, Database/Webserver Development, Natural Language Processing, Android/iOS App Development, Novel Recipes Generation, Ayurveda Informatics, Taste/Odor Prediction, Image Processing, Food Pairing Analysis, Carbon/Water Footprinting Calculations, Food Allergens, Food & Music, and Computational Creativity.

Brain correlates of affective states in autism
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) presents with a range of issues, e.g. decreased social-emotional reciprocity and non-verbal communication in social interactions; stereotyped repetitive movements, narrow spectrum of interests of unusual intensity and focus as well as sensory dysregulation (hyper/hyposensitivity to sensory inputs), which together
  manifest as different degrees of clinical severity. A school of thought proposes that the precipitation of one or more of these manifestations could be linked with internal affective/emotional states of the individuals with ASD and there is recent evidence in support of this thought (Chakrabarty M., et. al. European Journal of Neuroscience 2021). In this backdrop the incompletely understood brain bases of these affective states merit further investigation, which this internship seeks to address to a measurable extent.

Sieve methods in number theory
Sieve method originates from an algorithm for finding all primes. The earliest known Sieve method is the Sieve of Eratosthenes which utilizes the fact that a natural number is prime if and only if it is not divisible by any prime smaller than itself. Modern Sieve methods originated with Brun around 1920. He used a new Sieve to obtain several important number-theoretic results, notably an estimate of the density of twin primes. This project involves reading and understanding these methods and applying them in different number-theoretic problems.

(1) Developing novel counter measures for spoofing attacks in speaker verification (SV) system. (2) Bandwidth extension (BWE) in deep acoustic models
(1) The primary aim is to develop robust SV systems by highlighting the vulnerability of audio models. Recently, DNNs have been shown to be extremely brittle under adversarial and malicious attacks using generative models for speech synthesis. Thus, our goal is to develop novel counter measures against such attacks on SV systems, such that a robust front-end detection system can be deployed to compliment the back-end SV system.
    (2) The aim of BWE is to estimate the missing high frequency information i.e., extend the bandwidth of the signal. It is difficult to simultaneously model narrow-band and wide-band speech. Further there are computational constraints which limits the sampling rate for low latency applications. This project will explore novel approaches for BWE to improve the performance of deep acoustic models.

Reinforcement Learning for Algorithmic Trading
The MAB problem is a sequential decision-making framework where an agent chooses one or multiple actions, from a set of actions, based on the feedback of rewards from the previous choices. The MAB framework has found applications in the field of randomized clinical-trials, online recommendation systems, computational advertisement, and wireless communications. Advances in computational, storage and communication capacity have also led to the rapid advancement of deep-learning including deep-reinforcement learning (deep-RL) solutions.In this project, the student will explore bandit frameworks for algorithmic trading and propose novel bandit algorithms tuned for algorithmic trading. In particular, algorithmic trading consists of mechanisms enabling automated execution of pre-programmed trading instructions by taking into account variables such as time, price, and volume. Thus, the aim is to leverage the speed and computational resources of computers relative to human traders.

Discretizations of Exterior Calculus for Analysis, Geometry and Topology
The library https://github.com/dialkforkaushik/decagt has been developed at IIIT-Delhi and essentially implements in C++ computations for discrete exterior calculus and higher-order finite element exterior calculus. The current implementation has elements of multicore computations in it. The goal of the project for this summer would be two fold and independent of each other. One is to extend this package by porting some of the parallelizable computations to accelerators ("GPUs"). Such an implementation would necessarily involve, for instance, rethinking some data structures in the library (and supporting computational kernels) to make them more amenable to this parallelization. A second aspect of the project would be to improve some key aspects of the library's computational performance. While this is a more software engineering goal, it will be informed by the fundamentals of the computations rather than simply evaluating hot spots (or like) via black box performance analyzers.

Extracting program representations for machine learning
With the success of deep learning in computer vision, natural language tasks, researchers have been started to apply deep learning techniques for software engineering tasks as well. People have applied deep learning techniques to predict invariants, localize buggy lines in source code, etc. All these techniques use some intermediate program representation to extract meaningful and interesting program properties that can be fed to the deep learning model. In this project, we intend to leverage static analysis with machine learning to improve program representations; so that we can have deep richer information for deep learning models to learn from. We expect students to have relevant skills and a strong interest in at least one of the two areas i.e. program analysis or machine learning

Linear stability of periodic traveling waves of nonlinear PDEs
A periodic traveling wave solution of a nonlinear PDE is termed to be "stable" if it doesn't deviate from its original form in some sense. In general, it's a hard problem but instead of looking at the full nonlinear PDE, if we look at its linearized version, the analysis is relatively easy both analytically and numerically. In this project, we will study stability of periodic traveling waves of some shallow water wave models.

Comprehension of software binaries poses a number of problems as a compilation of source may add or remove certain instructions such as ghost operations introduced for function parameters, or replacement of log API call with a precomputed value in an optimized version of the binary. In this project, we intend to leverage machine learning and information retrieval approaches coupled with static analysis to summarize binaries. The project is organized in two phases. In the first phase, we will collect binaries for different popular algorithms compiled with different optimization levels and prune them using static analysis. In the second phase, we plan to use learning algorithms on the pruned dataset to comprehend the binaries.
Skills Required: C/C++, Basic knowledge of compilers, machine learning and/or information retrieval.

HPC implementation of discretizations of exterior calculus
Calculus on manifolds or exterior calculus is the language of differential forms that is finding increasing acceptance to express certain partial differential equations. These include equations of elasticity, electromagnetism and fluid flow. Discretizations of exterior calculus have therefore become crucial and, since the turn of the 21st century, somewhat pervasive. Discrete exterior calculus (DEC) and finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) have been two popular discretizations of exterior calculus, and a part of their success can be attributed to their discrete structure preserving properties. The standard package for performing computations in DEC and FEEC has been the Python library PyDEC (https://github.com/hirani/pydec) due essentially to Anil Hirani. This summer internship project shall strive to reimplement all objects and operators implemented PyDEC via C/C++ and with high performance computation (HPC) capabilities, and a Julia/Python frontend. This will require a rethink of the design and redevelopment of the framework.

Optimizing garbage collection for big-data platform
Modern languages guarantee memory and type safety, which is a major step towards bug-free code. However, they come with additional costs, which makes them impractical for performance sensitive workloads. One of the main reason behind these overheads is garbage collection. Garbage collection eliminates the burden of manual memory management and ensures temporal-safety. To achieve this, garbage collectors extensively use kernel memory management APIs. The garbage collection does remarkably well for applications with small memory footprint or when most of the objects have short lifetimes. However, for big-data workloads (works on GBs of data), it performs very poorly. The goal of this study is to understand the cost of memory management system call APIs and try to move them in the user-space (much like an exokernel way) for improving the performance of garbage collection.

Safe operating systems for low-cost embedded devices.
Low-cost wireless sensor nodes have severe storage and power constraints. Moreover, these architectures have limited support for memory management and protection. Despite these constraints, they need to provide services of a general purpose system. Because of the limited user interface, dependability is also a prime requirement. The goal of this project is to design a general-purpose OS for these platforms using a safe language, which meets the dependability requirement, while efficiently using the available resources.

Multimodal Social Media Computing
With the advent of smartphones and auto-uploaders, user-generated content (e.g., tweets, photos, and videos) uploads on social media have become more numerous and asynchronous. Thus, it is difficult and time taking for users to manually search (detect) interesting events. It requires for social media companies to automatically detect events and subsequently recommend them to their users. An automatic event detection is also very useful in an efficient search and retrieval of user-generated content. Furthermore, since the number of users and events on event-based social networks (EBSN) is increasing rapidly, it is not feasible for users to manually find the personalized events of their interest. We would like to further explore events on EBSN such as Meetup for different multimedia analytics projects such as recommending events, groups, and friends to users. We would like to use Deep Neural Network (DNN) technologies due to their immense success to address these interesting problems.     In recent years, advances in DNN technologies have yielded immense success in computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and speech processing. Especially, DNN has enabled significant performance boost in many visual tasks including image and video semantic classification, object detection, face matching and retrieval, text detection and recognition in natural scenes, image and video captioning, text classification, speech classification, item recommendation, and others. Recent studies confirm that DNN-based new representations contribute performance improvement in event detection and recommendation.     In addition to user-generated content (e.g., tweets, photos, and videos), a significant amount of social and contextual information is available on a social media platform. Thus, the goal of this project is to explore the new directions and the technologies of DNN-based event detection and recommendation leveraging multimodal social media information.

Switched Mode Kalman Filter for Real-time orbit determination at High Earth Orbits
For a highly non-linear system and low PDOP GNSS observations, the EKF and the Unscented type Kalman Filters provide similar accuracy. For high PDOP the Unscented type Filters provide better accuracy than the EKF. Hence, for a non-linear application with GNSS observations online switching of Kalman Filter variants based on the non-linearity and the PDOP can enable optimal use of computation resource. This can be particularly helpful for GNSS based orbit determination of spacecrafts in highly elliptical orbits.
