Placement Procedure & Policies
Placement Procedure
The Placement office (nodal point for placements & Internship at IIITD) sends invitations to companies/organizations along with relevant information.
Company/ Organization fills in a JAF (Job Announcement Form) containing details of the job offer (pay package, location, allowances and other bonuses). Along with the preferred dates of campus visit.
The duly filled JAFs should be sent to Placement Cell (rashmil@iiitd.ac.in).
Placement Office allots dates to companies for campus interviews based on various details given by companies. The company/ organization confirms the dates with the Placement Office.
Companies come down to the campus on the allotted date/s and conduct PPT /tests and/or interviews according to their recruitment process.
The company/ organization is required to furnish the final list of selected students on the same day of campus visit.
The company should hand over the duly signed hard copy of the final selection list to the placement cell.
In case the company is unable to declare the result on the same day, then the student is allowed to participate in other companies & the final status will depend upon who declares the result first.
The purview of the Placement Cell is restricted only to the offers made as part of the campus placement process.
The company shall provide the offer letters to the Placement office and not directly to the students.
* The Job Announcement Form provides the primary basis of communicating the details of the positions offered to the candidates. 
          It is therefore, highly desirable that the Form is completed in all respects and it would be advantageous if it were accompanied by 
          relevant company literature/JD.
