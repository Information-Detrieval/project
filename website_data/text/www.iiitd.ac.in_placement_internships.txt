Intern Hiring Process
The company needs to get in touch with the placement cell & share their requirements along with JD & stipend.
Information is shared with the students & the process is further initiated by the placement cell.
Internship Policy
We follow the "One Student One Internship" policy for all the above-mentioned internships. All offers are deemed to be accepted.
Code of Conduct
1. A student once registered for the Internship offered through the placement cell needs to complete the process. Failing to do so, leads to debarment from the internship and the placement process. 
2: Rejecting an internship offer is not allowed, doing so leads to the debarment both from the further campus internship and campus placement process. 
3: Off-campus internships are not under the preview of the placement cell, but at the same time if a student is also participating through the campus process then if he/she is offered /selected in the campus process, he/she will have to go with the campus offer & the Off-Campus offer will not be considered.
