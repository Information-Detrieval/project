 No plastic water bottles are used and glass reusable type bottles are used.
 We promote use of reusable jute/cotton grocery bags rather than plastic carry bags. Thickness of plastic carry bag if at all used is from 50-75micron.
 We ensure that the university vendors use reusable utensils, straws and plates.
 Plastic E wastes is collected periodically and given to authorized recyclers 
 Students, staff and faculty both work towards achieving the mission of use of single use plastic products at all levels from home, offices. hostels etc. Canteens will be promoted to make own Plastic-Free Snacks and buy Bread in Paper Bags 
Minimization of waste generation following the 3Râs. 
The University provides the mess and canteen operators with reusable stainless or reusable plates to enable wash and use rather than generating huge waste of the plastic packed plates, cups, trays etc . 
The damaged items are recycled and reused/ placed for buyback in replacement purchases whether these are furniture or equipment till their End of life to prevent generation of waste products. 
The MSW is segregated in blue green and red bins for dry, wet and E waste and collected by authorized agencies of the SDMC for safe disposal. 
The waste sewage water is treated in 4 Nos STP's and the same is reused in irrigation, horticulture and sludge for manures to make IIITD a zero discharge campus.
