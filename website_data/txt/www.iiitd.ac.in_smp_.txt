About
Student Mentorship Program (SMP) is a program within the IIIT Delhi student community, with the primary objective of enabling constructive and positive interaction, guidance and mentorship of junior students by senior students. The Student Mentor is generally more experienced than the Mentee and makes use of that experience in a facilitative way to support the first year students for their development. In a nutshell, a Student Mentor’s role may be perceived to be facilitative, supportive and developmental for the student community in general. The mentoring relationship provides a developmental opportunity not just to the Mentees but to the Mentors as well.
