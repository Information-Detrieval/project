                                <p>Agra, an old heritage city on the bank of the river Yamuna,  finds mention in the Epic Mahabharata as Agravan. Ptolemy, the famous 2nd  Century Geographer, marked it as Agra on the World map. It is generally  accepted that Sultan Sikandra Lodi, the Ruler of Delhi Sultanate founded it in  the year 1504 AD but the golden age of the city began with Mughal rulers after  1526 AD. It was then known as Akbarabad and remained the capital of the Mughal  Empire under Emperor Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan, Agra&rsquo;s significance as a  political center ended with the transfer of the capital to Delhi Â by Emperor Shah Jahan, but its architectural  wealth has secured its place on the International map.</p>

                            &ldquo;The embodiment of all things pure&rdquo;, said  Rudyard Kipling on Taj Mahal&rsquo;s beauty and that is no wordplay as the Taj is  undoubtedly a pure epitome of beauty. It is an immortal poem in white marble  and is the finest expression of love of an emperor for his queen. Located on a  bank of River Yamuna, it was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of  his beloved wife and Queen Mumtaz Mahal in 1631, who died giving birth to his  child and whose last wish to her husband was &ldquo;to build such a tomb in her  memory which the world has never seen before.&rdquo; It took over 17 years, 22000  workers and 1000 elephants to build the wonderful mausoleum.

The fort houses a maze of buildings, including vast underground  sections. The Amar Singh Gate to the south is the sole entry point. A path  leads straight from here up to the large Moti Masjid.
