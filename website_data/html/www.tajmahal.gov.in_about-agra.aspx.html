                        <div>
                            <p>Agra is a city offering a discovery of the beautiful era. Agra has a rich history, reflected in its numerous monuments dotted in and around the city. The earliest citation for  Agra comes from the mythological era, where the epic Mahabharata refer Agra as  &lsquo;Agravana&rsquo; meaning paradise in Sanskrit. &lsquo;Ptolemy&rsquo;, the famous second century  A.D. geographer, was the first person who referred Agra with its modern name.  The Modern Agra was founded by Sikandar Lodi, ruler of Lodi dynasty in 16th  century. It was when Shah Jahan descended the Mughal throne that Agra reached  the zenith of architectural beauty.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>The city lies in the Western part of Uttar Pradesh on the bank of River Yamuna. Though the wonderful allure of the Taj Mahal attracts people from around the world over to Agra, it is not a  standalone attraction. The city offers a trail of fascinating tombs and  mausoleums to explore. Acclaimed for its lavish crafts like Pietra Dura (marble  inlay) work, rugs and leather goods, and the luscious Petha, Agra equally  caters well to shopaholics and foodies.</p>
                        <hr class="bookends">
                        <h3>Major Attractions to Visit:</h3>
                        <h4>Taj Mahal</h4>
                        <p>
                            &ldquo;The embodiment of all things pure&rdquo;, said Rudyard Kipling on Taj Mahal&rsquo;s beauty and that is no wordplay as the Taj is  undoubtedly a pure epitome of beauty. It is an immortal poem in white marble  and is the finest expression of love of an emperor for his queen. Located on a  bank of River Yamuna, it was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of  his beloved wife and Queen Mumtaz Mahal in 1631, who died giving birth to his  child and whose last wish to her husband was &ldquo;to build such a tomb in her  memory which the world has never seen before.&rdquo; It took over 17 years, 22000  workers and 1000 elephants to build the wonderful mausoleum.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Taj Mahal is one of the three World Heritage Sites in India. Set in a serene Mughal Garden the monument stands on a raised marble platform, with its back towards Yamuna River. The  four sides of the Taj Mahal show a perfect symmetry and feature impressive  vaulted arches embellished with Pietra Dura scrollwork, and verses from the  Quran in calligraphy using inlaid jasper. This architectural masterpiece is one  of the most frequented places in India by photographers and foreign tourists.  The Taj Mahal looks as immaculate today as when it was first built, leaving the  onlookers mesmerized.</p>
                        <h4>Agra Fort</h4>
                        <p>A massive red-sandstone fort  located on the banks of River Yamuna was built under the commission of Emperor Akbar in 1565 and was further built by his grandson Shah Jahan. The fort,  semi-circular on plan, is surrounded by a 21.4 m high fortification wall. The  fort was built primarily as a military structure; parts of it are still  reserved under Indian Army. Shah Jahan transformed it into a palace, later it  became his gilded prison for eight years after his son Aurangzeb seized power  in 1658. The fort houses a maze of buildings, including vast underground  sections. The Amar Singh Gate to the south is the sole entry point. A path  leads straight from here up to the large Moti Masjid. Just before this is the  open Diwan-e-Aam, where Shah Jahan listened to people&rsquo;s petitions or issues. A  small staircase just to the left of Diwan-e-Aam throne leads up to a large  courtyard. To the left is a beautiful white marble Nagina Masjid. Other places  to see within the Fort are: Diwan-e-Khas - which once housed Shah Jahan&rsquo;s legendary  Peacock throne and the diamond Koh-I-Noor, Shish Mahal- a palace with walls  inlaid with tiny mirrors, and Khas Mahal - the white octagonal tower and  palace. In the South of the fort, there is a huge red-sandstone Jahangir&rsquo;s  Palace, built by Akbar probably for his son Jahangir.</p>

Its interior is covered with  exquisite calligraphy that reflects the tenets of Din-e-Ilahi, a religious  movement started by Emperor Akbar based on the fusion of primarily Hinduism and  Islam including other religions as well. Sikandra is the resting place of the  Mughal emperor Akbar and his grave lies here in a dark chamber. The outlying  garden which is laid out in the Char Bagh style is yet another attraction of  the place.</p>

The tiles used in the  monument can still be seen on a small part of the exterior while most of the  interior is painted in Floral Designs. This place is a curtain raiser to an  exotic Persian art style, which finds itself a home in Agra. You can visit the  place from sunrise to sunset any day.</p>

It is situated on the Delhi-Agra National  Highway, near Fatehpur Sikri. Born a Rajput Princess, Heer Kunwari was married  to Akbar in 1562, and rechristened as Mariam-uz-Zamani. She bore Akbar a son,  the future king, Jahangir. After her death in 1623, Jahangir built a tomb for  her close to Sikandra. The tomb has exceptional carvings and the ground floor  consists of some forty chambers built by Sikandar Lodi, which bear faint traces  of paintings on plastered walls. The centre of the ground floor houses the  cenotaph of Mariam.

                        <p>The Mughlai Food is a souvenir of the  Mughal era in India.The food has been borrowed from the Mughal kitchen.The  Mughlai dish mainly consists of meat enriched with creamy, boldly flavoured  curries; with lots of dried fruits with ground as well as whole spices. As time  passed, the Mughlai dishes travelled from Agra to different parts of North  India. However, the taste of Mughlai food in Agra is special and delicious.  When the Mughals made Agra the Capital city of India in the 16th century, they  left indelible imprints on the cuisine of Agra. The best places to get the lip  smacking and original taste of the Mughlai food in Agra are areas like Nai ki  Mandi area on MG road, Indiana, Pinch of Spice, Taj Mahal Restaurants on Fatehabad  road</p>
