Within the Fort there are a number of exquisite buildings, including Moti Masjid, Diwaan-e-Aam, Diwaan-e-Khaas and Musamman Burj, where Emperor Shah Jahan was kept during his imprisonment. Jahangir’s Palace, Khaas Mahal and Sheesh Mahal are the other important monuments inside the Fort. UP Tourism organises Light and Sound Show which provides an insight into the history of the monument, which is a visual delight.
