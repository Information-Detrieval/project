The division of each minaret into three equal parts by working balconies, topped by chattris that mirror the tomb's design, adds to the architectural splendor. The minarets are positioned slightly outside the plinth to ensure that in the event of a collapse, they would fall away from the tomb, reflecting thoughtful engineering alongside aesthetic considerations. The main finial, which integrates traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements, crowns the monument and underscores the Taj Mahal's synthesis of cultural symbols.

The overall interior decoration, with its emphasis on symmetry, naturalism, and a celestial theme, invokes a sense of eternal love and divine presence, making the Taj Mahal a true masterpiece of Mughal architecture."
www.tajmahal.gov.in_the-taj-interiors.aspx.txt,How does the design of the cenotaphs within the Taj Mahal reflect the monument's symbolic representation of eternal love and the afterlife?,"The design of the cenotaphs within the Taj Mahal deeply embodies the monument's symbolic representation of eternal love between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, as well as the Islamic concept of the afterlife.

Mumtaz Mahal's cenotaph, positioned at the exact center of the tomb chamber, and Shah Jahan's cenotaph, added beside it, are aligned north-south with their heads to the north, facing towards Mecca, signifying their readiness for the Last Judgment. The cenotaph of Shah Jahan is distinguished by a pen case on its top, symbolizing his status as a male tomb. This intricate arrangement and decoration of the cenotaphs, combined with the use of light and geometry, not only reflect the monument's aesthetic appeal but also its deeper spiritual and thematic meanings, centering on themes of love, loss, and the hope for eternal union in the afterlife."
