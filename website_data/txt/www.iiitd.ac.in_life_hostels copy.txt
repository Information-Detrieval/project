Several student clubs in the institute enable students to enhance talents in areas beyond academics.
Each hostel also has a Hostel Committee which is an advisory body comprising the Dean (Student Affairs) and the elected student representatives as its members. The Hostel Committee also coordinates with the Mess Committee for the running of the mess. Students can relax in the evenings or on holidays, or spend their leisure time in the Common Room which is equipped with a TV, newspapers and magazines. Sports and other recreational facilities are available on the upper floors of the dining building.
An external security agency has been contracted for providing security at the hostels. The services of the security personnel are monitored by the GM-Facility Management Services (FMS).
